## Garden Rules

1. Membership is at the discretion of the Nyack Community Garden’s Executive Committee.
2. All members must attend the general meeting on March 20.
3. Gates must be locked at all times and keys cannot be duplicated.
4. One 1⁄2 plot or one full plot is allowed per household.
5. Plots must be cleared of weeds and fully planted by May 18 or the plot will be re-assigned to someone on the waitlist.
6. Sunflowers, corn, tall plants, and non-permeable ground cover are not permitted.
7. Gardeners can not transfer a plot to another person without prior permission of the NCG Board.
8. Every gardener must participate in 1 or 2 (depending on time commitment) assigned committees and contribute at least six hours of work during the season.
9. Children under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult at all times.
10. You may only enter another garden members plot when invited.
11. Plot maintenance is required throughout the entire season. Email the garden if you are
unable to maintain your plot for any reason (out of town etc.). Avoiding food waste is our priority.
12. Every gardener is responsible for keeping their plot and the path in front of their plot free of
weeds. Weeds spread rapidly and become a nuisance for your neighbors and are not appreciated.
13. Every gardener is responsible for keeping the fence adjacent to their plot clear of vines and
all climbing plants during the entire season. This is a mandate from our generous land owner.
14. Return all tools to the shed free of debris after use. You must supply your own hand tools.
15. Bag all plant waste in brown compost bags and take them to the Depew Ave. curb.
Non-organic matter should be placed in the black garbage bin and taken to the curb when full.
16. Place unwanted rocks adjacent to the fence in your plot.
17. The garden closing date is November 2 at which point all plots must be cleared to look just as they
did when the garden opened in the spring.
18. The Nyack Community Garden is not responsible for plants and other personal items left in
the garden.
19. No dogs are allowed in the garden with the exception of service animals trained to aid a
disabled person.

**Failure to adhere to the rules and regulations at any time may result in the loss of garden membership or other penalties.**
