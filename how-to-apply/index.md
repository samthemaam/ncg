The Garden is open to people in the Nyack School District. To apply for a plot in the  Nyack Community Garden please email [membership@nyackcommunitygarden.info](mailto:membership@nyackcommunitygarden.info). In your email please include:

- Your name
- Your address
- Your telephone number

Applicants should be 18 years or older. Applicants who were not in the Garden the previous year are eligible for ½ plots which are approximately 90 square feet and cost $40, subject to availability. A full plot is 180 square feet, costs $50 for a season, and may be available to gardeners who were in the Garden the previous year, worked on committees, and maintained their plots. Applicants who have never been in the Garden get placed on a waiting list, and their position on the waiting list is determined by postmark date of their application. Each year some gardeners will not return to the garden, so spots open up each season for new gardeners.
